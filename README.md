**Finding the Number of Clusters Using Elbow Method**
 **Introduction**
 Air quality has undergone significant changes over the years due to increasing activities such as biomass 
burning, transport emissions, and industrial operations (Govender and Sivakumar, 2020). The 
deterioration of air quality caused by particulate matter (PM) has been linked to a rise in respiratory and 
cardiovascular diseases, as well as increased mortality rates (Govender and Sivakumar, 2020). These 
health risks underscore the importance of understanding and managing air pollution patterns. Clustering 
is a widely used technique in environmental studies to analyze air pollution and uncover patterns within 
datasets (Harinath and Marthy, 2020; Govender and Sivakumar, 2020). It groups similar observations 
based on shared characteristics, enabling researchers to identify meaningful insights and trends. One 
popular clustering algorithm, K-Means, iteratively assigns data points to clusters and recalculates 
centroids until convergence, resulting in distinct groups with similar internal features and clear 
separations between clusters.
 This study applies unsupervised clustering, specifically the K-Means algorithm, to analyze air pollution 
data and group regions based on similar pollution patterns. To handle the dataset's high dimensionality, 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, enabling effective 
visualization of clusters in two-dimensional space. The optimal number of clusters was determined using 
the Elbow Method, ensuring robust and meaningful groupings. The primary objective of this analysis is 
to uncover distinct air quality profiles based on key pollutants, including Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen 
Dioxide (NO₂), Ozone (O₃), PM2.5, and PM10, thereby contributing to a better understanding of 
regional air quality patterns.
